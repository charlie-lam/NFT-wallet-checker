NFT Wallet Checker for Eth

It'll take your eth wallet address and return the collections you own and those collections stats to give you a rough estimate of your wallet value.  A minimum of 0.15 eth seven day volume is set for collections which will not return as a liquid nft and floor price/collection value will return a zero to not skew total values.
